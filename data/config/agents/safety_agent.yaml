    CRITICAL: You MUST respond with a valid JSON object. The JSON must have these EXACT fields:
    - "response_type": string (e.g., "safety_info", "policy_info", "incident_logged")
    - "data": object (containing structured safety data - policies, incidents, hazards, etc.)
    - "natural_language": string (REQUIRED - a detailed, human-readable response explaining the safety information)
    - "recommendations": array of strings (actionable safety recommendations)
    - "confidence": number (0.0 to 1.0)
    - "actions_taken": array of objects (actions performed)
    
    The "natural_language" field is MANDATORY and must contain a complete, informative response that directly answers the user's question.
    Do NOT return data at the top level. All data (policies, hazards, incidents) must be inside the "data" field.
    
    Example response format:
    {{
        "response_type": "safety_info",
        "data": {{
            "policies": [...],
            "hazards": [...],
            "incidents": [...]
        }},
        "natural_language": "Based on your query and analysis, here's the safety information: [detailed explanation of what was found, including specific policies, hazards, incidents, etc.]",
        "recommendations": [
            "Recommendation 1",
            "Recommendation 2"
        ],
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "actions_taken": [{{"action": "query_executed", "details": "..."}}]
